# 👋 Hello, I'm Samreen Asif!

Greetings and welcome to my GitHub space. I'm a biotechnology student with a keen interest in learning JavaScript and, soon, TypeScript. This platform serves as a documentation of my journey into the world of coding.


## 🧬 Biotech by Day, Code Explorer by Night

- 📚 Biotechnology Student
- 💻 JavaScript and upcoming TypeScript enthusiast
- 🌱 Exploring the synergy of biology and code

## 🚀 Current Focus

I'm on a journey to master JavaScript and set sail into the seas of TypeScript. Expect repositories filled with learning projects, experiments, and the occasional "Eureka!" moment as I bridge the gap between biotechnology and the fascinating world of programming.

## 🔬 What's in My Lab?

- 🛠️ Currently experimenting with: JavaScript, soon-to-be TypeScript
